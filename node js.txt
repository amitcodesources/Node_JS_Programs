Introduction to Node Js:-
==================
=>Node js is the server side scripting language. 
=>Node js is used to build the servers. By using node js we can build HTTP and TCP servers.
=>We can build the node applications by using java script.
=>Java script is mono threaded i.e  single threaded. so node applications also mono threaded application.
=>Node supports the modules (pre defined modules & custom modules).
=>Node means pre defined library.

Modules in Node Js:-
================
1.Http module:-
-------------------
 	Http module is the pre defined module . Http module also called as native module. Http module is used to 
devlope Http server. Http module avilable along with the node engine.

2.Url module:-
..........................
=>url module is the pre defined module
=>url module also available along with the Node engine.
=>url module is used to read the get parameters in Http servers.

3.Query string module:-
-----------------------------
=>it is also native module.
=>it is used to read the post parameter in http servers.

4. fs module:-
-----------------
=> 'fs' stands for "file system".
=>it is also native module.
=>'fs' module is used to perform the operations on flat files.
Ex:- reading the data from flat files.
       writing the data to the flat files.
       creating the data from flat files.

5.Express module:-
------------------------
=>Express module is the third party module.		npm install express --save
=>it is used to devlope the web services (Rest API).
=>providing the communiction b/w different technologies called as web services.

6.MS sql module:-
...............................
=>MS sql module also third party module.
=>MS sql module used to interact with the mysql database.

7.Mongo db module:-
--------------------------
=> Mongo db module used to interact with Mongo db database.
=>The stable version of Mongo db is 2.2.32.
=>it is also third party module.

8.MySql :-
=======
=>MySql module also third party module.
=>MySql module used to interact with the Sql Server.

9.Body-Parsar module:-
==================
=>Body-Parsar module is the third party module.
=>It is used to set the MIME type.
Ex:- xml,Json, text...
=>It is also used to read the post parameters in Express Js.

10.Jwt- simple module:-
==================
=>Jwt- simple module is used to generate the tokens.
=>Jwt- simple module generated tokens we will use for authentication purpose.
=>Jwt- simple module authentication called as "token based authentication system".

11.Multer module:-

=>In cookies we can store maximum 4mb data.
=>Cookies are in key & value pairs.
=>Cookies are not secured.

15. Cluster:-
==========
=>Cluster module is used to implement the load balancing in node Server.

16.Express cluster:-
------------------------
=>This module is used to implement the load balancing in Rest Services.

Note:-
=====
1.No need to download the pre-defined modules.
2.Pre-defined modules avaliable along with the Node Software.
3.We must download third party modules.
4.Third party modules will be downloads  to "node-modules" folder in current path.
5.We will download third party modules with the help of "yarn'' packaging manager.
6. "yarn" is the packaging manager used to download the node modules in a faster manner.




Creating Http Server:-
================

Create folder - CreatingHttpServer - 
Inside this folder create a file -  server.js
Write below code inside server.js file


	//import http module
//http module is the predefined module
//http module is used to create http server
//no need to download http module
//http module is available along with the node engine
//http module is called native module
//require() is the predefined function in node JS
//require() used to import the modules
var http = require("http");
//create the http server
//createServer() is the predefined function used to create http server
var server = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
    //set the MIME Type
    //writeHead(_,_) is the predefined function in res object to the MIME Type
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type':'text/html'});
    //send the response to client
    //write() is the predefined function used to send the response to the client
    res.write("<h1 style='color:red'>Welcome to First Http Server...</h1>");
    //lock the res object 
    //end() is the predefined function to lock the res object
    res.end();
});
//assign the port no to http server 
server.listen(8080);
console.log("Server listening the port no 8080");


To run this open terminal
write command - 	node server.js
To see the output open browser
write in address bar -		http://localhost:8080/
